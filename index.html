        Hello. My name is Aryan Mikaeili and I am currently a Computer Engineering B. Sc. student at <a href="http://www.en.sharif.edu/">Sharif University of Technology</a>.
      <br />
      I am a research assistant at the <a href="http://ipl.ce.sharif.edu/">Image processing lab (IPL)</a>, where under supervision of  <a href="http://sharif.ir/~kasaei">Prof. Shohreh Kasaei</a> I work on adversarial attacks on deep 3D point cloud models and geometric interpretability of these models.
      <br />
      I am mainly interested in 3D computer vision, robust deep learning and interpretability of deep networks. But, I am also interested in other topics in computer vision and machine learning such as generative models, human pose estimation, image segmentation and etc.

    <h1> Activities and Hobbies </h1>
      I'm a classical pianist. I have played the piano for almost 13 years. Over the years I have played a vast repertoire from J.S Bach to D.D Shostakovich. in 2018 I was among the finalsts of the National Javan music festival and National Barbad music festival. Also I was ranked first and second in the Competition for Tehran's cultural centers in 2010 an 2009 respectively.
      Additionaly I have been fortunate to benefit from masterclasses of celebrated pianists such as Dilbar Hakimova from Moscow conservatory and Tamara Dolidze from Tbilisi state conservatory. I'm currently practicing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghTitIMtTCM">Italian concerto in F major</a> by Bach.
      <br />
      <br />
           I also enjoy playing chess and soccer.
